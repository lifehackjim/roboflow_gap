# roboflow_gap: Simplifying Computer Vision for Everyone

Fill in the GAP: gather, analyze, and process images and videos in seconds â€” no coding required.

## Inspiration

Drawing inspiration from the user-friendly approaches of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [AnythingLLM](https://useanything.com/), our mission is to democratize advanced image processing and analysis with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/), making it accessible to all.

## Introduction

The computer vision workflow involves three key stages: gathering, analyzing, and processing images. 

Creating tools for these stages typically demands considerable time, domain expertise, and coding skills.

Enter roboflow_gap. Designed to streamline your computer vision projects, it will eventually offer:

- **Gather**: An intuitive interface to collect images from cameras, screenshots, the internet, and more.
- **Analyze**: Straightforward access to Roboflow's comprehensive computer vision libraries for detailed image analysis and detection.
- **Process**: Handy tools for adding annotations to images, setting the stage for further insights and connections, such as linking identified objects to their Wikipedia entries.
- **CLI Tool**: An easy-to-use command-line interface that brings the power of roboflow_gap to all users, regardless of their technical skills.
- **User Support**: Ensuring that even complex computer vision tasks are within reach, with straightforward instructions and supportive feedback for users at any technical level.
- **TBD**:
  - **WebUI**: A visual interface to monitor the progress and outcomes of your roboflow_gap workflows, making it even easier to see the results of your computer vision projects in real time.

## Analyzer Task Types

Supported by the [inference python package](https://github.com/roboflow/inference/), a broad spectrum of task types awaits, each tailored for specific capabilities and use cases.

Dive into our [Task Types documentation](docs/task_types.md) for an in-depth exploration of each task type.

Quick highlights include:

- **classification**: Easily labels images with categories but doesn't show where objects are.
- **object-detection**: Finds and shows where objects are in an image.
- **instance-segmentation**: Marks the exact edges of each object in an image, showing every detail.
- **keypoint-detection**: Points out important spots on objects, like where parts of the body are.
- **embedding**: Changes images so that similar ones can be grouped together, helping with searching and sorting.
- **gaze-detection**: Figures out where someone is looking, helping us understand what catches their eye.
- **lmm (Language Models for Machines)**: Combines seeing images and understanding words to describe what's in the images or answer questions about them.
- **ocr (Optical Character Recognition)**: Turns text in images into text you can edit and search.
- **unsupervised-segmentation**: Finds and separates objects in images all by itself, without needing examples to learn from.
